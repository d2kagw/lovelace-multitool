## What is Muto?

Muto stands for Multi-Tool - a combination of basic UI elements that enable user interaction designed for tablet use.

The principles of Muto might look familiar for those with web-dev experience as the layouts are put in your hands through cards like "flexbox" and such.

Note: Muto has been built and designed for my personal use, so there are likely lots of bugs or edge cases not supported.

### Features

-   üõ† A basic set of components to build complete custom UIs
-   üòç tablet focused designs and interactions - with expectations of horizontal layouts, finger-control and scrolling
-   üñå Consistent placement of Clocks, Alerts and Security cameras
-   üöÄ 0 dependencies : no need to install another card.
-   üåà Themeable without external themes

## Installation

### Manual

1. Download `muto.js` file from the [latest-release].
2. Put `muto.js` file into your `config/www` folder.
3. Add reference to `muto.js` in Dashboard. There's two way to do that:
    - **Using UI:** _Settings_ ‚Üí _Dashboards_ ‚Üí _More Options icon_ ‚Üí _Resources_ ‚Üí _Add Resource_ ‚Üí Set _Url_ as `/local/muto.js` ‚Üí Set _Resource type_ as `JavaScript Module`.
      **Note:** If you do not see the Resources menu, you will need to enable _Advanced Mode_ in your _User Profile_
    - **Using YAML:** Add following code to `lovelace` section.
        ```yaml
        resources:
            - url: /local/muto.js
              type: module
        ```

## Usage

TBC

### Cards

tbc

## Development server

### Home assistant demo

You can run a demo instance of Home Assistant with docker by running:

```sh
npm run start:hass
```

Once it's done, go to Home Assistant instance [http://localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123) and start configuration.

### Development

In another terminal, install dependencies and run development server:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Server will start on port `4000`.

### Home assistant configuration

Once both Home Assistant and muto are running, you have to add a resource to Home Assistant UI:

-   Enable `Advanced Mode` in your profile page
-   Go to Dashboard Resources and add the resource `http://localhost:4000/muto.js`:  
    _Settings_ ‚Üí _Dashboards_ ‚Üí _More Options icon_ ‚Üí _Resources_ ‚Üí _Add Resource_ ‚Üí Set _URL_ as `http://localhost:4000/muto.js` ‚Üí Set _Resource type_ as `JavaScript Module`.

### Build

You can build the `muto.js` file in `dist` folder by running the build command.

```sh
npm run build
```
