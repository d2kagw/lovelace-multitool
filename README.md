## What is Muto?

Muto stands for Multi-Tool - a combination of basic UI elements that enable user interaction designed for tablet use.

The principles of Muto might look familiar for those with web-dev experience as the layouts are put in your hands through cards like "flexbox" and such.

Note: Muto has been built and designed for my personal use, so there are likely lots of bugs or edge cases not supported.

### Features

-   üõ† A basic set of components to build complete custom UIs
-   üòç tablet focused designs and interactions - with expectations of horizontal layouts, finger-control and scrolling
-   üñå Consistent placement of Clocks, Alerts and Security cameras
-   üöÄ 0 dependencies : no need to install another card.
-   üåà Themeable without external themes

## Installation

1. Download `muto.js` file from the [latest-release].
2. Put `muto.js` file into your `config/www` folder.
3. Add reference to `muto.js` in Dashboard. There's two way to do that:
    - **Using UI:** _Settings_ ‚Üí _Dashboards_ ‚Üí _More Options icon_ ‚Üí _Resources_ ‚Üí _Add Resource_ ‚Üí Set _Url_ as `/local/muto.js` ‚Üí Set _Resource type_ as `JavaScript Module`.
      **Note:** If you do not see the Resources menu, you will need to enable _Advanced Mode_ in your _User Profile_
    - **Using YAML:** Add following code to `lovelace` section.
        ```yaml
        resources:
            - url: /hacsfiles/lovelace-muto/muto.js
              type: module
        ```
4. _(Optional)_ Install the `Barlow` font from Google Fonts using one of the two methods mentioned in step 3

    - **Using UI:** _Settings_ ‚Üí _Dashboards_ ‚Üí _More Options icon_ ‚Üí _Resources_ ‚Üí _Add Resource_ ‚Üí Set _Url_ as `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Barlow:wght@300;400;600;700&display=swap` ‚Üí Set _Resource type_ as `Stylesheet`.
      **Note:** If you do not see the Resources menu, you will need to enable _Advanced Mode_ in your _User Profile_
    - **Using YAML:** Add following code to `lovelace` section.
        ```yaml
        resources:
            - url: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Barlow:wght@300;400;600;700&display=swap
              type: css
        ```

5. Reload themes by restarting home assistant, or using the keyboard shortcut `c`, then type `reload themes`
6. Set the `Muto` theme for all users by going to _Developer Tools_ ‚Üí _Services_. Select the service `Home Assistant Frontend: Set theme`. Select `Muto` from the list of themes, and press _Call Service_.

# Cards

The component is responsive, and will move to a single column layout on narrow devices.

Example use of the card is as follows:

```yaml
- type: custom:muto-layout-card
  columns:
      - flex: 0 0 20%
        cards: ...
      - flex: 2 2 30%
        cards: ...
```

### Configuration
